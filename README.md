# Machine Learning Inference with GitHub Actions

This repository demonstrated how you can use *Github Actions* to perform inference with your ML model.

<img src="art/issue_comment_prediction.png" width="400" alt="sample comment">

The GitHub Actions workflow is triggered when an issue receives a comment, and if the comment contains the `/predict`
prefix, then the `main.py` python file starts to parse the comment, make a prediction and construct the reply to the
original comment with the prediction. Example (and also valid) comment: `/predict <float> <float> <float> <float>`
e.g. `/predict 5.6 2.9 3.6 1.3`

## Files

- `action.yml`: Describes the action which build a Docker image and performs the comment parsing and inference
- `.github/workflows/main.yaml`: contains the steps which are performed when a comment is received under an issue
- `Dockerfile`: This is the image which will be built and used for the main action
- `issue_comment.sh`: With this script you can send a comment with the GitHub Rest API
- `main.py`: parses the content of the comment, loads model, makes prediction and constructs the reply message
- `random_forest_model.pkl`: Serialized trained sklearn model which will be used for inference (btw. this file should
not be here, as model artifacts should be stored in a storage, but this is just a sample so... :smile:)
